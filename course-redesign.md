# Course redesign

This is an attempt to combine learning that I am doing across a number of fronts into some video reflections. I have decided to "burn my class to the ground" that I'm getting in the Spring of 2024. Often, I have this feeling, but don't do anything about it. This time, however, I am going for it.

## Challenges

- Too much stuff (content and assignments)
- Emerging uses of AI makes authentic assessment more challenging
- My version of hyflex (asynchronous and online synchronous) can be difficult
- My organization can be lacking, at times

## Opportunities 

- Less is more
- Templates and AI tools can assist with the organizational challenges
- Open educational resources are more doable than ever

## Tools for experimentation 

- Text editor: [Typora](Typora *gives you a seamless experience as both a reader and a writer*. It removes the preview window, mode switcher, syntax symbols of markdown)
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- [LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaScript/docs/master/README.md#1)
- [Teaching Tools](https://teaching.tools/)
- [ChatGPT 4.0](https://openai.com/gpt-4)
- Others

## Goals 

- Create an engaging, compassionately challenging experience for learners around vital aspects of business ethics
- Have the technology be hidden, in the sense that the experience is seamless: Any surprises come as a result of the content and engagement with other people, not the technology not working well/effectively 

```
