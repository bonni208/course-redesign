# Course redesign

This is an attempt to combine learning that I am doing across a number of fronts into some video reflections. I have decided to "burn my class to the ground" that I'm getting in the Spring of 2024. Often, I have this feeling, but don't do anything about it. This time, however, I am going for it.

## Challenges

- Too much stuff (content and assignments)
- Emerging uses of AI makes authentic assessment more challenging
- My version of hyflex (asynchronous and online synchronous) can be difficult
- My organization can be lacking, at times

## Opportunities

- Less is more
- Templates and AI tools can assist with the organizational challenges
- Open educational resources are more doable than ever

## Goals 

![Old fashioned typewriter with a piece of paper in it that says "goals"](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/markus-winkler-LNzuOK1GxRU-unsplash.jpg)

- Create an engaging, compassionately challenging experience for learners around vital aspects of business ethics
- Have the technology be hidden, in the sense that the experience is seamless: Any surprises come as a result of the content and engagement with other people, not the technology not working well/effectively
